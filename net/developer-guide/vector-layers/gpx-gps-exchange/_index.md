## **Working with GPS Exchange File (GPX) Files**
Aspose.GIS lets you open and read features from GPS Exchange File (GPX) files. At present, the API doesn't provide the facility to create a new GPX file and only reading is supported.
## **Reading Features from GPX File**

## **Write Polygons As Lines to GPX File**
GPX format does not support polygons and multipolygons. As result, sometime conversion is failed from other formats. You should apply the WritePolygonsAsLines option to resolve this issue.
